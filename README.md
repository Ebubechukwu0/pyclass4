# pywk4 File Read & Write Challenge

This Python project demonstrates how to read a file, modify its contents, and write the result to a new file, with error handling for missing or unreadable files.

## Features

- Prompts the user for an input and output filename.
- Reads the content of the input file.
- Modifies the content (currently converts all text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified content to the output file.
- Handles errors if the input file does not exist or cannot be read/written.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Place the file you want to read in the same directory as `pywk4.py` or provide the full path.
3. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python pywk4.py
   ```

4. Enter the input filename when prompted.
5. Enter the desired output filename.

## Example

```
Enter the input filename: SMART GRID.txt
Enter the output filename: SMART GRID UPPER.txt
Modified content written to SMART GRID UPPER.txt
```

## Files

- `pywk4.py` - Main Python script.
- `SMART GRID.txt` - Example input file.
